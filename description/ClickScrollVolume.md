# About
**_Click Scroll Volume_**  I created a hotkey using the Right Mouse button and Scroll Wheel to control the volume.

**What's in this code?**
- Prevents context menu from showing up when hotkey is being activated
- It doesn't break Left click drag functionatlies
- Tray icon is from C:\Windows\System32\DDORes.dll
